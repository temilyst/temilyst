## 🌱 My Data Analytics Journey

Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Temitope Ebo, and I am a data analyst with a passion for transforming data into actionable insights.

I began my academic journey with a degree in Food and Nutrition at FUNAAB, but my interest in data and its potential to drive decision-making led me to explore a new path. This curiosity became a career pivot when I enrolled in a **Data Analytics certification program at Axia Africa**, where I gained hands-on experience with **Excel**, **SQL**, and **Power BI** through practical, real-world business scenarios.
